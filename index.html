                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
                physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
                appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
                equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics. He
                was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
                particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead
                he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
                with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
                evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy
                that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
                faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
                instant. If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes
                like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like
                a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out
                all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not
                missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the
                ocean. “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top
                of the page and drew a double box around it.

                On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers
                reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and
                that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
                right. Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to

                Guth was correct.

                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years,
                though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever
                be proved.
              </p>

              <p>
                If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
                science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy
                pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would
                open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and
                speculation.
              </p>

              <p>
                Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
                extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
                billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
                cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
                Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless
                number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a
                pot of pasta water boiling over.

                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
                operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
                accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity
                itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct
                observation of gravitational waves, which, according to
                Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle
                space-time. Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an
                early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This
                is huge, as big as it gets.” He continued, “This is a signal
                from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
                gravitational waves.” The ripples manifested themselves as faint
                spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates
                space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was
                380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun. Dr.
                Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
                Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
                Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at
                the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of
                papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

                Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only
                one in 10 million. Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled
                over,” saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation
                in his lifetime.

                Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every

                “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as
                scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as
                he tended his radio telescopes. Andrei Linde of Stanford, a
                prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant
                of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to
                go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a

                Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had
                ordered anything. “And then I told him that in the beginning we
                thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we
                ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order
                it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email. Calling from
                Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still
                hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of
                spoiling a vacation,” he said. By last weekend, as social media
                was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news
                spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation
                and caution. Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an
                email, “I think that if this stays true, it will go down as one
                of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.” John E.
                Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and
                head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope,
                pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are
                beautiful and very convincing,” he said. Paul J. Steinhardt of
                Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the
                clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that
                if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he
                expressed reservations about inflation. Lawrence M. Krauss of
                Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for
                confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier
                estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by
                the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other
                assumptions about the universe. “So we will need to wait and see
                before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said. Corroboration
                might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report
                its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are
                trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and
                space.

                Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of
                the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by
                Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They
                won the Nobel Prize. Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to
                read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of
                Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive
                radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air
                creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke
                of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California
                Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford. “The South Pole
                is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,”
                Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering
                over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

              The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the

                In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the
                microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a
                slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than
                another. This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting
                the gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing
                space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go
                by, would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves,
                theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky
                should have little arrows going in spirals. Detecting those
                spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in
                the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope,
                Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer. “We
                had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said. The
                strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent
                a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure
                they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat
                them to the breakthrough.
              </p>
              <h4 class="bold__text">A Special Time</h4>
              <p>
                The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists
                like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years
                ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the
                universe. Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world
                today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear
                forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply
                different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled
                the universe in its earliest, hottest moments. As the universe
                cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace,
                like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out
                with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force
                after another splitting away. That was where Dr. Guth came in.
                Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as
                the temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed,
                at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
                Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified
                state too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued
                with a mysterious latent energy. Inserted into Einstein’s
                equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity,
                and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself
                supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created, the
                harder it pushed apart. What would become our observable
                universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold —
                from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of
                a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink. Almost as
                quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary
                particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still
                ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky
                and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that
                there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say,
                “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”

                Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models
                resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that
                inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe
                settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the
                cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles
                endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse. So the future of
                the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother
                asking about going any deeper into the past. We might never know
                what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because
                inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos
                and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, forever
                out of our view. “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham
                Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the
                team, “you wind up at inflation.”
