            <p>
              CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
              physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
              at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
              venturing far beyond the world of known physics. He was trying to
              understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that
              should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered
              what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential
              hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
              infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
              repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
              speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant. If true, the
              rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look
              uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The
              enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
              irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
              diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean. “SPECTACULAR
              REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a
              double box around it. On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in.
              Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the
              Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as
              inflation, looked right. Reaching back across 13.8 billion years
              to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South
              Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the
              Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in
              the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the
              signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was
              roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second
              old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation,
              proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was
              correct. Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35
              years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could
              ever be proved. If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a
              landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark
              energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It
              would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and
              speculation. Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we
              see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds
              of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a
              larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
              Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
              of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of
              pasta water boiling over. of a single unified force that ruled the
              universe in its earliest, hottest moments. As the universe cooled,
              according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some
              old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each
              other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another
              splitting away. That was where Dr. Guth came in. Under some
              circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature
              falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it
              will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat. Similarly, the
              universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long.
              In that case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious
              latent energy. Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent
              energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would
              blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive
              force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.
              What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at
              least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of
              primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a
              cosmic eye-blink. Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside,
              relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All of normal
              cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable
              universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across.
              “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr.
              Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free
              lunch.”
